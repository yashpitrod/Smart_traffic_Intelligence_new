  summary: "Smart Traffic Intelligence is an agentic AI platform that transforms raw Bengaluru traffic incident data into predictive intelligence and actionable deployment plans. Four specialized AI agents work in concert — parsing multilingual incident descriptions, predicting severity and resolution time, detecting zone-level anomalies in real time, and generating field-ready response plans — all orchestrated through a single unified dashboard.",
