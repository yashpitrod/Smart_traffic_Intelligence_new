# architecture.md — Smart Traffic Intelligence System

## Complete Architecture Reference: Endpoints, Models, Agents, Data Flow, and Frontend-Backend Integration

> **Living Document:** As the project evolves, all structural changes — new endpoints, modified feature vectors, agent prompt updates, UI changes — must be reflected here before merging. Keep this file in sync with the repo.

## 1. System Overview

A real-time traffic intelligence dashboard for Bengaluru traffic authorities. The system ingests 8,173 historical traffic incidents, trains ML models on them, and exposes a FastAPI backend that serves a React frontend. Users can monitor live anomalies zone-by-zone, submit new incidents (via structured form or free-text description in any language), and receive an ML-predicted priority classification, resolution time estimate, and an LLM-generated deployment action plan — all from a single interface.

**Tech stack at a glance:**

| Layer       | Technology                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend    | Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet.js, Recharts, SSE       |
| Backend     | FastAPI (Python)                                                          |
| ML Models   | XGBoost (classifier + regressor), Isolation Forest                        |
| LLM         | Groq API  (Agents 1 and 4, plus Geocoding)           |
| Data        | Bengaluru traffic incident CSV (8,173 records), held in-memory at runtime |
| Persistence | None during session; `feedback.jsonl` for post-demo review                |

## 3. API Endpoints

All endpoints are served by FastAPI. The dataset DataFrame and all trained models are loaded into memory at server startup. No database is used.

### `GET /health`

**Purpose:** Quick liveness probe.

**Input:** None.

**Output:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "Smart Traffic Intelligence API",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

---

### `GET /heatmap`

**Purpose:** Provide weighted lat/lng data for the Leaflet heatmap layer.

**Input:** None.

**Output:**

```json
[
  { "lat": 12.9716, "lng": 77.5946, "weight": 2.4 },
  ...
]
```

Weight formula: `base_weight * duration_factor`

- `base_weight`: 2 if `priority == "High"`, 1 if `priority == "Low"`
- `duration_factor`: normalized `resolution_minutes` (0–1 scale, computed at startup)

Computed once at startup from the full dataset and cached. Frontend calls this once on load for the default static view.

---

### `GET /heatmap/replay`

**Purpose:** Provide dynamically accumulating lat/lng data for the "City Replay" mode.

**Output:** Same JSON structure as `/heatmap`.

**Mechanism:** Returns the current state of a background loop that streams chronological incidents (3 every 0.066 seconds). Frontend polls this every 5 seconds when City Replay is active.

---

### `POST /heatmap/replay`

**Purpose:** Resets the heatmap replay accumulator to the beginning of the dataset.

---

### `GET /incidents`

**Purpose:** Serve incident records. (Currently unused in UI since markers were removed, but kept for backend completeness).

**Input (query params):**

| Param        | Type                                | Description          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `zone`       | string (optional)                   | Filter by zone name  |
| `priority`   | "High" \| "Low" (optional)          | Filter by priority   |
| `event_type` | "planned" \| "unplanned" (optional) | Filter by event type |
| `page`       | int (default: 1)                    | Pagination           |
| `page_size`  | int (default: 200)                  | Records per page     |

**Output:**

```json
{
  "total": 8173,
  "page": 1,
  "incidents": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "lat": 12.9716,
      "lng": 77.5946,
      "address": "...",
      "junction": "...",
      "corridor": "...",
      "event_type": "unplanned",
      "priority": "High",
      "status": "closed"
    }
  ]
}
```

(Previously used by frontend to color-code markers).

---

### `POST /nlp-parse`

**Purpose:** Run Agent 1 on a free-text incident description.

**Input (JSON body):**

```json
{ 
  "description": "ಬಿಎಂಟಿಸಿ ಬಸ್ ಕೆಟ್ಟು ನಿಂತಿದೆ ಸರ್",
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" // optional
}
```

**Output (success):**

```json
{
  "root_cause": "vehicle_breakdown",
  "vehicle_type": "bmtc_bus",
  "severity": 2,
  "action_needed": true,
  "normalized_summary": "BMTC bus has broken down at the reported location."
}
```

**Output (failure / parse error):**

```json
null
```

Frontend shows the parsed fields in the Incident Panel as a "Parsed from description" section. On null, the frontend falls through to the user's typed structured fields.

---

### `POST /geocode-zone`

**Purpose:** Use Groq AI to resolve a free-text Bengaluru area/zone name (or any location within an approx 600km radius of Bengaluru) into geographic coordinates. Used only by the View 2 submit form.

**Input (JSON body):**

```json
{ "zone": "HSR Layout Sector 2" }
```

**Output (high confidence):**

```json
{
  "confidence": "high",
  "lat": 12.915,
  "lng": 77.643,
  "resolved_name": "HSR Layout Sector 2"
}
```

**Output (ambiguous):**

```json
{
  "confidence": "ambiguous",
  "candidates": [{ "name": "...", "lat": 12.1, "lng": 77.1 }]
}
```

Frontend either proceeds automatically, or shows the `ZoneClarificationModal` to prompt the user to resolve ambiguity.

---

### `POST /predict`

**Purpose:** Run Agent 2 — classify priority and estimate resolution time.

**Input (JSON body):**

| Field                   | Type                        | Source                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `event_type`            | "planned" \| "unplanned"    | Form or NLP parse     |
| `event_cause`           | string (dataset vocabulary) | Form or NLP parse     |
| `corridor`              | string                      | Form                  |
| `requires_road_closure` | boolean                     | Form                  |
| `veh_type`              | string \| null              | Form or NLP parse     |
| `zone`                  | string \| null              | Derived from location |
| `junction`              | string \| null              | Typed or pin-derived  |
| `start_datetime`        | ISO string                  | Form or current time  |
| `planned_end_datetime`  | ISO string \| null          | Planned events only   |

**Output:**

```json
{
  "priority": "High",
  "confidence": 0.84,
  "estimated_duration_minutes": 130,
  "estimated_resolution_time": "2025-06-16T19:30:00Z"
}
```

This endpoint always runs — for new form submissions and for anomaly zone alerts.

---

### `POST /action-plan` _(Server-Sent Events)_

**Purpose:** Run Agent 4 and stream the LLM action plan token-by-token.

**Input (JSON body):** Full incident context assembled from the original fields plus `/predict` output:

| Param                        | Description                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `event_type`                 | planned / unplanned                    |
| `event_cause`                | e.g. vehicle_breakdown                 |
| `address`                    | Display address                        |
| `junction`                   | Junction name                          |
| `corridor`                   | Human-readable corridor label          |
| `police_station`             | Responsible station                    |
| `zone`                       | Zone name                              |
| `priority`                   | High / Low                             |
| `confidence`                 | Float (0–1)                            |
| `estimated_duration_minutes` | Integer                                |
| `requires_road_closure`      | true / false                           |
| `nlp_cause`                  | From Agent 1 (if ran)                  |
| `nlp_summary`                | From Agent 1 (if ran)                  |
| `is_zone_alert`              | true if triggered from Anomaly Monitor |
| `model`                      | Groq model ID (optional)               |

**Output:** SSE stream. Each event is a plain text token chunk. The frontend accumulates tokens and renders them in a typewriter-style component.

The plan always contains exactly six labeled sections: **Officers, Barricades, Diversion, Estimated Clearance, Escalation Trigger, Public Advisory.**

For planned events (`event_type == "planned"`), the prompt instructs pre-emptive deployment — resources are positioned before event start, not dispatched reactively.

---

### `GET /anomaly`

**Purpose:** Return current anomaly scores for all zones, updated every 0.09 seconds by the background replay loop.

**Input:** None.

**Output:**

```json
[
  {
    "zone": "HSR Layout",
    "alert_level": "Critical",
    "incident_count": 5,
    "high_priority_ratio": 0.9,
    "mean_duration": 85,
    "anomaly_score": -0.43
  },
  ...
]
```

Alert level thresholds: `anomaly_score > 0` = Normal, `-0.1 to 0` = Watch, `< -0.1` = Critical.

Frontend polls this endpoint every 5 seconds and simultaneously updates zone polygon fill colors on the map and badge colors on the Anomaly Monitor sidebar cards.

---

### `POST /anomaly/replay`

**Purpose:** Resets the anomaly replay loop to the beginning of the dataset, clearing accumulators and starting the stream from index 0.

---

### `GET /analytics`

**Purpose:** Serve analytics datasets in a single response. Computed once at startup from the in-memory DataFrame.

**Input:** None.

**Output:**

```json
{
  "volume_grid": { "7x24 matrix of incident counts by day_of_week × hour_of_day" },
  "top_junctions": [
    { "junction": "Silk Board", "count": 142, "lat": 12.9175, "lng": 77.6228 }
  ],
  "corridor_durations": [
    { "corridor_rank": 2, "label": "Named Corridor", "median_minutes": 55 },
    { "corridor_rank": 1, "label": "ORR Variant", "median_minutes": 72 },
    { "corridor_rank": 0, "label": "Non-Corridor", "median_minutes": 38 }
  ],
  "planned_vs_unplanned": [
    { "month": "2023-01", "planned": 12, "unplanned": 98 }
  ]
}
```

---

### `POST /feedback`

**Purpose:** Record a user thumbs-up or thumbs-down on an action plan.

**Input (JSON body):**

```json
{
  "incident_context": { "zone": "...", "event_cause": "...", "priority": "High", ... },
  "action_plan": "Officers: Deploy 4 officers to...",
  "rating": "up"
}
```

**Output:**

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

Appends one JSON line to `feedback.jsonl`. Not used for live retraining — exists for post-demo review.

---

### `GET /feedback`

**Purpose:** Return all feedback entries for post-demo inspection.

**Input:** None.

**Output:**

```json
[
  { "timestamp": "...", "incident_context": {...}, "action_plan": "...", "rating": "up" }
]
```

---

## 4. The Four Agents

All agents are Python functions inside the FastAPI backend — not separate services.

### Agent 1 — NLP Description Parser

**Triggered by:** `POST /nlp-parse` when the user has entered a free-text description.

**Skipped when:** User submits structured fields only, with no description.

**Input:** Raw string in any language (Kannada, English, mixed, transliterated).

**Internal process:**

1. Backend constructs a Groq API call.
2. System prompt: structured extraction agent for Bengaluru traffic incidents.
3. User message: few-shot example (one Kannada input → expected JSON output) + raw user string.
4. Model is instructed to return only a JSON object — no preamble, no explanation.

**Output (success):**

```json
{
  "root_cause": "vehicle_breakdown", // one of the dataset's event_cause values
  "vehicle_type": "bmtc_bus", // one of the dataset's veh_type values, or null
  "severity": 2, // 1 (low) | 2 (medium) | 3 (high)
  "action_needed": true,
  "normalized_summary": "BMTC bus has broken down at the reported location."
}
```

**Output (failure):** `null`

**Frontend behavior:** Displays parsed fields in the Incident Panel as "Parsed from description" before the prediction loads. On null, silently falls through.

---

### Agent 2 — Prediction Agent (XGBoost)

**Triggered by:** Every call to `POST /predict` (form submissions and anomaly alerts).

**Input:** Feature vector constructed identically at training time and inference time via `build_feature_vector(input_dict) → numpy_array`.

| Feature                 | Encoding                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `latitude`              | Float                                                            |
| `longitude`             | Float                                                            |
| `requires_road_closure` | Binary: 0 or 1                                                   |
| `hour_of_day`           | Integer 0–23                                                     |
| `day_of_week`           | Integer 0–6                                                      |
| `is_peak_hour`          | Binary (1 if hour in [7,8,9,10,17,18,19,20])                     |
| `is_weekend`            | Binary (1 if day_of_week in [5,6])                               |
| `corridor_rank`         | Integer (frequency count of incidents per corridor)              |
| `junction_recurrence`   | Integer from lookup table; default=1 for unknown                 |
| `event_cause_enc`       | Label encoded against the dataset's cause vocabulary             |
| `veh_type_enc`          | Label encoded (returns -1 when vehicle type is unknown)          |
| `zone_enc`              | Label encoded; a dedicated "unknown" label is reserved for nulls |

**Two models, same feature vector:**

**Classifier (XGBoost):** Trained on authenticated incidents where `priority` is not null. Target: `priority` (0=Low, 1=High). Class imbalance handled with `scale_pos_weight`. Returns predicted class + probability.

**Regressor (XGBoost):** Trained on ~3,205 records where `resolution_minutes` is computable, positive, and ≤ 1,440 min. Target: `resolution_minutes`. Returns a float rounded to nearest minute.

**Output:**

```json
{
  "priority": "High",
  "confidence": 0.84,
  "estimated_duration_minutes": 130,
  "estimated_resolution_time": "2025-06-16T19:30:00Z"
}
```

Models are serialized with joblib and loaded at server startup. Inference: < 100ms.

---

### Agent 3 — Anomaly Detection Agent (Isolation Forest)

**Triggered by:** Background `asyncio` task running every 0.09 seconds during the demo. Not triggered by user actions directly.

**Grouping:** Records where `zone` is null are grouped by `police_station` instead, ensuring all 8,173 records contribute to the baseline.

**Baseline training:** For each unique `(zone_or_station, day_type, time_bucket)` combination, three statistics are computed:

- `mean_incident_count` — average incidents per day in this bucket
- `high_priority_ratio` — fraction of High-priority incidents
- `mean_duration_minutes` — average resolution time in minutes

Each combination becomes one row (a 3D feature vector). The Isolation Forest is trained on all rows.

**Replay mechanism:** During the demo, the backend streams a small batch of chronological incidents every 0.09 seconds into a pure per-zone accumulator (incidents are never removed; they only accumulate over time). The three statistics are computed from this ever-growing accumulated state per zone and fed to the Isolation Forest. When the dataset is exhausted, the replay loop stops and freezes at the final state.

**Output per zone:**

```json
{
  "zone": "HSR Layout",
  "alert_level": "Critical",
  "incident_count": 5,
  "high_priority_ratio": 0.9,
  "mean_duration": 85,
  "anomaly_score": -0.43
}
```

Alert level mapping: `> 0` = Normal, `-0.1 to 0` = Watch, `< -0.1` = Critical.

---

### Agent 4 — Action Planner Agent (LLM, SSE)

**Triggered by:** `GET /action-plan` after `POST /predict` completes.

**Input:** Full context block assembled from the original incident fields + Agent 2 output (see endpoint section above).

**Internal process:**

1. Backend constructs a Groq API call with `stream=True`.
2. System message: traffic authority operations assistant with Bengaluru road network knowledge.
3. User message: all context fields in labeled plaintext.
4. Instruction: produce exactly six labeled sections; no preamble.
5. For planned events: prompt specifies pre-emptive deployment framing.
6. Backend streams each token chunk as an SSE event to the frontend as it arrives.

**Output:** Plain-language action plan, streamed as SSE, always in six sections:

1. **Officers** — count and deployment positions
2. **Barricades** — placement instructions
3. **Diversion** — suggested alternate routes (uses model's built-in Bengaluru knowledge)
4. **Estimated Clearance** — projected time to resolution
5. **Escalation Trigger** — conditions under which to escalate
6. **Public Advisory** — message for motorists/public

**Frontend behavior:** Typewriter-style rendering as tokens arrive. Thumbs-up/down feedback buttons appear only after streaming completes.

### Flow C — Anomaly Monitor → Generate Plan

```
Background task (every 0.09s):
    incidents stream into pure per-zone accumulator (never removed)
    → compute (incident_count, high_priority_ratio, mean_duration) from accumulated state
    → Isolation Forest scores all zones
    → GET /anomaly cache updated

Frontend polls GET /anomaly every 5s:
    → Zone polygon fill colors updated on map
    → Anomaly Monitor sidebar cards updated

User clicks "Generate Plan" on a zone card:
    → NLP parse skipped
    → POST /predict (zone-level context)
    → GET /action-plan SSE (framed as pre-emptive zone alert)
    → Incident Panel opens (same as Flow A)
```

## 6. Frontend Views and Component Wiring

### View 1 — Map (default on login)

**Components:**

- `LeafletMap` — full-screen, four layers:
  1. Heatmap layer (Leaflet.heat plugin). Defaults to static historical data from `GET /heatmap`, with a "City Replay" mode that polls `GET /heatmap/replay` dynamically.
  2. Zone polygons (convex hulls computed from dataset lat/lng grouped by zone; fill color driven by `GET /anomaly`)
  3. Incident Pin Layer: pulsing red markers for submitted incidents via View 2.
- `AnoalyMonitorSidebar` — collapsible, left or right side:
  - One card per zone: name, alert badge, three numbers (count / ratio / duration)
  - "Generate Plan" button triggers Flow C

**API calls on load/runtime:**

1. `GET /heatmap` (once on load)
2. `GET /heatmap/replay` (polled every 5s if replay mode is active)
3. `GET /incidents` (paginated, initial load)
4. `GET /anomaly` (polled every 5s)

**Interactions:**

- "Generate Plan" click → `POST /predict` → `GET /action-plan` SSE → `IncidentPanel` opens
- Junction bar click in Analytics → map pans to that junction

---

### View 2 — Submit Incident

**Components:**

- Single form with two input modes:
  - **Structured:** dropdowns for event type, event cause, corridor; pin drop on mini-map; datetime picker; vehicle type
  - **Description:** textarea (any language); NLP parse runs on submit if non-empty
- Both modes: typed address field

**On submit:**

1. If description non-empty → `POST /nlp-parse`
2. `POST /geocode-zone` to resolve Zone/Area
3. (If ambiguous, show `ZoneClarificationModal` to resolve)
4. `POST /predict`
5. Map marker drops via `onPinDropped` callback
6. `GET /action-plan` SSE
7. `IncidentPanel` opens

---

### View 3 — Analytics

**Components (data from `GET /analytics`, loaded once):**

- **Chart 1:** Hourly volume profile — bar chart of hourly averages and day-of-week totals.
- **Chart 2:** Junction leaderboard — top 15 junctions by incident count.
- **Chart 3:** Area chart — planned vs unplanned monthly volume.

**API calls on load:**

1. `GET /analytics` (once)

---

### IncidentPanel (shared across all views)

A right-side drawer that opens from two triggers: form submit, anomaly zone "Generate Plan."

**Sections:**

| Section           | Content                                                                 | When visible                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Incident details  | address, junction, corridor, event cause, event type, time              | Always                          |
| NLP parse result  | root_cause, vehicle_type, severity, normalized_summary                  | Only if Agent 1 ran             |
| Prediction result | Priority badge (High/Low), confidence %, estimated clearance clock time | After `/predict` resolves       |
| Action plan       | LLM output, streamed typewriter-style, 6 labeled sections               | After `/action-plan` SSE begins |
| Feedback row      | Thumbs-up / thumbs-down buttons                                         | After streaming fully completes |

**Panel states:**

1. Loading (spinner) — prediction in flight
2. Prediction loaded, plan streaming — badge visible, plan typing out
3. Complete — full plan visible, feedback buttons active

## 7. Feature Engineering Reference

These are computed from raw dataset columns before training. The same logic runs at inference via `build_feature_vector()`.

| Derived Feature            | Computation                                                                                  | Notes                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resolution_minutes`       | `closed_datetime - start_datetime` (minutes); fallback: `resolved_datetime - start_datetime` | Drop if negative, zero, null, or > 1,440 min. ~3,205 records survive. |
| `planned_duration_minutes` | `end_datetime - start_datetime` (minutes), planned events only                               | Null for unplanned.                                                   |
| `hour_of_day`              | `start_datetime.hour`                                                                        | Integer 0–23                                                          |

| `is_peak_hour`             | 1 if hour in [7,8,9,10,17,18,19,20]                                                          | Binary                                                                |
| `is_weekend`               | 1 if day_of_week in [5,6]                                                                    | Binary                                                                |
| `corridor_rank`            | Incident frequency count for the corridor                                                    | Higher values = more historically prone                               |
| `junction_recurrence`      | Count of appearances of each junction string in dataset                                      | Lookup table at inference; default=1 for unknown/null                 |
| `time_bucket`              | hour 6–10: morning_peak, 10–16: afternoon, 16–21: evening_peak, else: night                  | Used for anomaly grouping                                             |
| `day_type`                 | weekday / weekend from day_of_week                                                           | Used for anomaly grouping                                             |

**Null handling:**

- `zone`: null in 57% of records. Do not drop — use "unknown" label class. For anomaly detection, null-zone records group by `police_station`.
- `junction`: null in 69% of records. `junction_recurrence` defaults to 1 for null.
- `veh_type`: null in ~40% of records. Label encoding returns -1 for null.

## 8. Build Sequence

Strict dependency order. Each stage produces artifacts the next stage consumes.

**Stage 1 — Data pipeline and models**
Load CSV → filter `authenticated=yes` → handle nulls (null-safe encoding, not row-dropping) → compute all derived features → build `junction_recurrence` lookup table → build zone label encoder with "unknown" class → label encode `event_cause` and `veh_type` → compute `resolution_minutes` with primary/fallback logic → drop outliers → train XGBoost classifier (with `scale_pos_weight`) → train XGBoost regressor → compute anomaly baseline aggregate table → train Isolation Forest → serialize all models with joblib → write `build_feature_vector()` function used identically at train and inference time.

**Stage 2 — Backend endpoints**
Write Agent 1 prompt and `POST /nlp-parse` → test against 5 real Kannada/mixed descriptions from dataset → write `POST /predict` → write Agent 4 prompt and `GET /action-plan` with SSE (test SSE with curl before connecting frontend) → implement anomaly replay loop as FastAPI `asyncio` background task → write `GET /anomaly`, `GET /heatmap`, `GET /incidents`, `GET /analytics` → write `POST /feedback` and `GET /feedback`.

**Stage 3 — Frontend core**
Set up Leaflet map → integrate heatmap plugin → build zone polygons as convex hulls → build Anomaly Monitor sidebar polling `/anomaly` every 5s → build IncidentPanel drawer with three states.

**Stage 4 — Frontend form, analytics, polish**
Build Submit Incident form (both input modes) → wire three-step API sequence (`/nlp-parse` if description, then `/predict`, then `/action-plan` SSE) → build Analytics page (all three Recharts charts) → wire junction bar click to map pan → wire feedback buttons to `POST /feedback` (buttons appear only after streaming completes) → add loading skeletons and error handling.
